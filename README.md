# React + Vite

cd valorantAPI
npm i
npm run dev

This is my first project alone. I wanted to make this website because my first "web" (only html and css) was about this videogame.

I've tried to improve my knowledge about React and acquire new ways to develop with this framework. Also, the home page its completely make with styled components

This web consists of an API call to get all information about the game and print it in different sections. Besides, you can add favorites the elements you like and see all in the favorite section
